# Liquid Templates

MAIAR ships with **[Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)** as the _first-class_ templating engine for prompts. Liquid's familiar `{{ handlebars }}` syntax, logic tags, and filters make it easy to:

- Separate long, hard-to-read prompt strings from TypeScript logic
- Re-use snippets across multiple executors / triggers
- Inject rich JSON contexts without messy string concatenation
- Preview and iterate on prompts in isolation

> **_Why Liquid?_**  
> Unlike raw template literals, Liquid lends structure and re-usability. It's battle-tested (Shopify, Jekyll, etc.) and has a solid TypeScript implementation via **[liquidjs](https://liquidjs.com/)** that MAIAR embeds under the hood.

## Registering templates in your plugin

1. **Create a `prompts/` folder** inside your plugin package. Put one `.liquid` file per template:

```
packages/plugin-my-awesome/prompts/
├─ plugin_description.liquid
├─ generate_email.liquid
└─ follow_up_question.liquid
```

2. **Point the runtime at that directory** when you construct the plugin:

```ts
import path from "path";

import { Plugin } from "@maiar-ai/core";

export class MyAwesomePlugin extends Plugin {
  constructor() {
    super({
      id: "plugin-awesome",
      name: "Awesome",
      description: async () =>
        (
          await this.runtime.templates.render(`${this.id}/plugin_description`)
        ).trim(),
      requiredCapabilities: ["text-generation"],
      // 👇 tells MAIAR where to find your .liquid files
      promptsDir: path.resolve(__dirname, "prompts")
    });

    // … executors / triggers …
  }

  // …
}
```

:::warning
It's important that the `promptsDir` folder location is not the current location in your working project. It should be the resulting location of when your plugin is built. You will need to copy these files to the correct location in your build directory as part of your build process.
:::

The **Runtime** automatically calls `promptRegistry.registerDirectory()` for every plugin that declares `promptsDir`, namespacing each file under `<pluginId>/`.

---

## Rendering a template

Inside your executors (or anywhere you have access to `this.runtime`):

```ts
const prompt = await this.runtime.templates.render(
  `${this.id}/generate_email`, // ← template ID
  {
    userName: "Alice",
    previousTopics: task.contextChain.slice(-5)
  }
);

const response = await this.runtime.executeCapability(
  "text-generation",
  prompt
);
```

The second argument is an arbitrary object that becomes the Liquid **render context** (`{{ userName }}`, `{% for t in previousTopics %}`, …).

---

## Template IDs & Lookup Rules

- **ID format**: `<namespace>/<fileName>` (without the `.liquid` extension).
- The **namespace** is the `id` you passed to the plugin constructor (`plugin-awesome` in the example).
- Sub-folders are supported – `prompts/email/welcome.liquid` → `plugin-awesome/email/welcome`.

If you attempt to render an ID that hasn't been registered, the runtime throws a descriptive error so you catch typos early.

---

## Liquid features at your disposal

Liquid gives you all the essentials for ergonomic prompt engineering:

- **Interpolation** – `Hello, {{ userName }}!`
- **Control flow** – `{% if condition %} … {% endif %}`
- **Loops** – `{% for item in list %} … {% endfor %}`
- **Filters** – `{{ title | downcase }}`
- **Partials / includes** – `{% include 'shared/header' %}` (works across your `promptsDir`)
- **Error throwing** – `{% throw "Error message" %}` (useful for required fields that are not provided)

For the full language reference see the [_Liquid Documentation_](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and the **[liquidjs guide](https://liquidjs.com/tutorials/)**.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep logic in templates, data in TypeScript.** Push conditionals/loops to Liquid so your executors stay thin.
2. **Avoid stray whitespace.** End lines with `{%-` / `-%}` where necessary to trim newlines — this helps the LLM focus on the important text.
3. **Name templates descriptively.** `summarise_context.liquid` beats `template1.liquid`.
4. **Co-locate instructions with data.** Include comments/instructions _within_ the template so the LLM sees them together.

_That's it!_ Point MAIAR at your `prompts/` folder and start leveraging the power of Liquid to craft expressive, maintainable prompts.
